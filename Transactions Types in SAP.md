In SAP, the codes you listed (`MKPF`, `RMRP`, `VBRK`) are not transaction codes (T-codes) but rather **table names**. Here's what each represents:

---

### **1. `MKPF` (Header of Material Document)**
- **Purpose**: Stores header data for material movements (goods receipts, goods issues, transfers).
- **Key Fields**:
  - `MBLNR` (Material Document Number)
  - `MJAHR` (Fiscal Year)
  - `BUDAT` (Posting Date)
  - `USNAM` (User who posted)
- **Related Transactions**:
  - **`MB03`** (Display Material Document)
  - **`MIGO`** (Goods Movement)

---

### **2. `RMRP` (Reminder/Dispute Management: Payment Reminders)**
- **Purpose**: Stores data related to payment reminders or dunning notices in Accounts Receivable.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `MABNR` (Reminder Number)
  - `KUNNR` (Customer Number)
  - `BELNR` (Accounting Document)
- **Related Transactions**:
  - **`F26`** (Create Payment Reminders)
  - **`F28`** (Process Dunning)

---

### **3. `VBRK` (Billing Document Header)**
- **Purpose**: Contains header data for billing documents (invoices, credit memos).
- **Key Fields**:
  - `VBELN` (Billing Document Number)
  - `FKART` (Billing Type, e.g., "F2" for invoice)
  - `NETWR` (Net Value)
  - `KUNNR` (Sold-to Customer)
- **Related Transactions**:
  - **`VF03`** (Display Billing Document)
  - **`VFX3`** (Billing Document List)

---

### **Summary Table**
| **Table** | **Description** | **Key Field** | **Related T-Code** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| `MKPF` | Material Document Header | `MBLNR` (Doc Number) | `MB03`, `MIGO` |
| `RMRP` | Payment Reminders | `MABNR` (Reminder No.) | `F26`, `F28` |
| `VBRK` | Billing Document Header | `VBELN` (Billing Doc) | `VF03`, `VFX3` |

Now your question might be why not just keep MKPF?
Not necessarily. Whether you should keep only `MKPF` or also include `RMRP` and `VBRK` depends on **what aspect of production data** you're analyzing. Here's how to decide:

---

### **1. If You Need Only Core Production Material Movements → Keep `MKPF`**
- **What it gives you**:  
  - Records of **goods receipts/issues** (production inputs/outputs)  
  - Stock transfers, inventory adjustments  
  - Links to batches (`MSEG.CHARG`) and production orders (`AUFNR`)  

- **Use Case**:  
  - Tracking raw material consumption  
  - Finished goods production postings  
  - Warehouse-level production visibility  

- **Limitations**:  
  - No financial values (costs, prices)  
  - No link to sales/billing  

---

### **2. If You Need Financial Impact of Production → Add `VBRK` (Billing)**
- **Why include it**:  
  - Connects produced goods to **sales invoices** (if sold)  
  - Shows revenue recognition from production output  

- **Use Case**:  
  - Profitability analysis per production batch  
  - Linking production volumes to sales  

- **Join Logic**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT m.MBLNR, m.BUDAT, v.VBELN, v.NETWR
  FROM MKPF AS m
  JOIN MSEG AS ms ON m.MBLNR = ms.MBLNR AND m.MJAHR = ms.MJAHR
  JOIN VBRP AS vp ON ms.MATNR = vp.MATNR  -- Billing item (material link)
  JOIN VBRK AS v ON vp.VBELN = v.VBELN     -- Billing header
  WHERE ms.BWART = '101'  -- e.g., goods receipt for production
  ```

---

### **3. If You Need Disputes/Rework Tracking → Add `RMRP`**
- **Why include it**:  
  - Tracks **post-production disputes** (e.g., customer complaints on quality)  
  - Identifies rework or scrap costs  

- **Use Case**:  
  - Quality control analytics  
  - Cost of non-conformance (CONC) analysis  

---

### **Recommendation Based on Your Goal**
| **Scenario** | **Tables to Keep** | **Key Data** |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Pure production volume tracking | `MKPF` + `MSEG` | Material movements, batches |  
| Production + Financial impact | `MKPF` + `VBRK` | Costs, sales value |  
| Production + Quality issues | `MKPF` + `RMRP` | Rework, disputes |  

**For most production analytics**, `MKPF` (joined with `MSEG` for batches/materials) is the core table. Add others only if you need financial or quality dimensions.
