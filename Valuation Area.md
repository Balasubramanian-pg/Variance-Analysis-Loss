In SAP, **valuation areas** define organizational units where materials are valuated (assigned monetary values) independently. They determine whether valuation occurs at the **plant level** or **company code level**. Here’s what your listed codes likely represent and how valuation areas work:

---

### **1. Key Concepts**
- **Valuation Area** (`BWKEY` in SAP tables):
  - Can be set at **Company Code** (e.g., `1001`) or **Plant** (e.g., `5001`).
  - Governs whether material prices are uniform across plants or plant-specific.
- **Valuation Level** (Configured in `OX14`):
  - **Company Code Level**: All plants in the same company code share material prices.
  - **Plant Level**: Each plant can have different material prices (common in manufacturing).

### **2. Your Listed Valuation Areas**
| **Code** | **Likely Meaning** | **Valuation Level** |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **(blank)** | Default/not assigned | N/A |
| **1001** | Company Code (e.g., US operations) | Company Code |
| **2001** | Company Code (e.g., EU operations) | Company Code |
| **4001** | Company Code or Special Plant | Depends on config |
| **5001**, **5004**, **5005**, **5021** | **Plant-Level Valuation Areas** (e.g., production sites) | Plant |

### **3. How to Verify**
1. **For Company Codes**:
   - Check table `T001` (Company Codes) → `BUKRS` field.
   - Transaction `OX02` (Display Company Codes).
2. **For Plants**:
   - Check table `T001W` (Plants) → `WERKS` field.
   - Transaction `OX10` (Display Plants).

---

### **4. Business Impact**
- **Plant-Level Valuation (e.g., 5001)**:
  - Used when material costs vary by location (e.g., regional tariffs, local suppliers).
  - Enables plant-specific profit/cost analysis.
- **Company Code-Level Valuation (e.g., 1001)**:
  - Simplifies accounting but hides plant-specific cost differences.

---

### **5. Common Tables Linked to Valuation Areas**
- **MBEW** (Material Valuation): Stores prices per valuation area (`BWKEY` = plant/company code).
- **MSEG** (Material Documents): References `BWKEY` for inventory postings.

---

### **Example Query**
To find material valuations for plant `5001`:
```SQL
SELECT MATNR, BWKEY, VERPR, STPRS 
FROM MBEW 
WHERE BWKEY = '5001'.
```
