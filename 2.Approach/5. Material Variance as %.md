## DAX Measures for Variance Loss Percentage

I'll create variance loss % measures for each category that has both actual and standard measures. The formula will follow your specified pattern: `ABS((Actual - Standard)/Standard)*100`

Here are the complete DAX measures:

## 1. Bottles New Variance Loss %
```dax
Bottles New Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Bottles New (Actual)] - [Bottle New (Standard)]),
    [Bottle New (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 2. Bottles Old Variance Loss %
```dax
Bottles Old Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Bottles Old (Actual)] - [Bottle Old (Standard)]),
    [Bottle Old (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 3. Can Variance Loss %
```dax
Can Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Can (Actual)] - [Can (Standard)]),
    [Can (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 4. Crown Variance Loss %
```dax
Crown Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Crown (Actual)] - [Crown (Standard)]),
    [Crown (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 5. Labels Variance Loss % (330ml)
```dax
Labels 330ml Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Label (Actual)] - [Labels (330ml) (Standard)]),
    [Labels (330ml) (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 6. Labels Variance Loss % (650ml)
```dax
Labels 650ml Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Label (Actual)] - [Labels (650ml) (Standard)]),
    [Labels (650ml) (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## 7. Ringpull Variance Loss %
```dax
Ringpull Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Ringpull (Actual)] - [Ringpull (Standard)]),
    [Ringpull (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

## Implementation Notes:

1. Each measure uses `DIVIDE()` with a 0 return for divide-by-zero cases
2. `ABS()` ensures the variance is always positive
3. Multiplied by 100 to convert to percentage
4. The measures correspond to the pairs you showed in your image
5. Note: Filled Beer and Carton weren't included as they didn't have both standard and actual in your list

## For Carton (if you need it later):
```dax
Carton Variance Loss % = 
DIVIDE(
    ABS([Carton (Actual)] - [Carton (Standard)]),
    [Carton (Standard)],
    0
) * 100
```

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any of these formulas for specific business rules?
2. Create a consolidated variance measure that handles all categories?
3. Add any additional error handling or conditional logic?
