**How to Use This List:**
*   **SE16N / SE16 / SE11:** Use these SAP transaction codes to browse the table contents or view their structure.
*   **Primary Keys:** Understanding the primary keys of these tables is crucial for linking them (e.g., `MATNR` for material number, `WERKS` for plant).
*   **Context is Key:** The relevance of each table depends on the specific SAP modules and business processes implemented in your organization.

This list should provide a solid foundation for understanding material-related data in SAP!
