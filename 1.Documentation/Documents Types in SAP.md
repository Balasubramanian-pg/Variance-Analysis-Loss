In SAP, the codes you listed (e.g., `AA`, `PR`, `RV`, etc.) are **document types (BKPF-BLART)** used to classify accounting documents. Each represents a specific kind of financial transaction. Below is a breakdown of their meanings:

---

### **Common SAP Document Types (BLART)**
| **Code** | **Description** | **Typical Use Case** |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **AA**   | Asset Posting (Depreciation, Acquisition) | Fixed asset accounting (FI-AA) |
| **PR**   | Price Change (Material Valuation) | Inventory revaluation (MM) |
| **RE**   | Invoice Verification (Vendor Invoice) | GR/IR clearing (MIRO) |
| **RV**   | Sales-Related Invoice | Customer billing (SD + FI) |
| **WA**   | Goods Movement (Warehouse) | Goods receipt/issue (MM) |
| **WE**   | Withholding Tax | Tax-related postings |
| **WI**   | Work in Process (WIP) | Production cost accounting (CO) |
| **WL**   | Service Entry Sheet | Service procurement (MM-SRV) |
| **Z2**   | Custom Document Type 1 | Often used for internal adjustments |
| **Z3**   | Custom Document Type 2 | Company-specific postings |

### **Key Details**
1. **Financial vs. Logistics**:
   - `RV`, `WA`, `RE` are common in logistics (SD/MM) with financial impact.
   - `AA`, `WE`, `WI` are pure FI/CO postings.

2. **Custom Types (`Z2`, `Z3`)**:
   - Defined by companies for special processes (check your SAP configuration).

3. **Link to Transactions**:
   - `RE` → **`MIRO`** (Vendor Invoice)
   - `RV` → **`VF01`** (Billing Document)
   - `WA` → **`MIGO`** (Goods Movement)

### **How to Verify in SAP**
1. **Transaction `OBA7`**: List all document types in your system.

### **When to Use Which?**
- **Production Cost Tracking**: `WI` (WIP) + `WA` (Goods Movements).
- **Sales Revenue**: `RV` (Billing Documents).
- **Asset Management**: `AA`.
