These billing types (likely custom **document types** or **billing categories** in SAP) are prefixed with **`Z`**, indicating they are **custom-defined** by an organization to meet specific business needs. Below is a general explanation of their potential purposes based on common naming conventions in SAP:

---

### **Custom Billing Types (VBRK-FKART) in SAP SD**
These are typically used in **Sales and Distribution (SD)** for invoices, credit memos, debit memos, and other billing documents. Since they begin with `Z`, they are **not standard SAP** types but tailored to the organization's processes.

1. **Transaction `V/12`**: Display billing type configuration.  
2. **Table `TVFK`**: Master table for billing document types.  
3. **Field `FKART`**: Check in `VBRK` (Billing Header) or `VBRP` (Billing Item).

### **Key SAP Tables for Billing Types**
- **`VBRK`**: Billing header (contains `FKART`).  
- **`TVFK`**: Billing type definitions.  
- **`TVAK`**: Sales document type assignments.

### **Example Use Cases**

   - Linked to sales order type `ZDP` (if custom).  

2. **`ZEX1` (Export Invoice)**
